# Student Database
While doing work with a Barber School, I noticed that they were using an outdated method (essentially, Excel, pen and paper) to house and manage their student population information. I saw that they could benefit from a a simple CRUD application that would make managing their data much more efficient. I created an Asp.Net application in Visual Studio 2017, coded in C# and connected a databse. Below is a sample of the code and functionality.
